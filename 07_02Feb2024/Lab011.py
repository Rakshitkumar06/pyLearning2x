pie =3.14

print("Area of a circle = %.2f" %area)


#Firstly, we will take input from the user using the input() function for radius
# and store it in a variable.
#We can use constant to store the value of ‘pi’.
#Now, we will calculate the area of a circle by using the formula area = PI * r * r.
#And at last, print the area of a circle to get the output.
